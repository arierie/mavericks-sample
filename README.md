# Simple app with MVRX implementation and new Android JetPack#

## MvRx: Android on Autopilot ##

According to Airbnb official documentation, MvRx (pronounced mavericks) is the Android framework from Airbnb that we use for nearly all product development at Airbnb.

When we began creating MvRx, our goal was not to create yet another architecture pattern for Airbnb, it was to make building products easier, faster, and more fun. All of our decisions have built on that. We believe that for MvRx to be successful, it must be effective for building everything from the simplest of screens to the most complex in our app.
